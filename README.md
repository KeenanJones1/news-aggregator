* Faster for Setup
* Retry and fallbacks must be handled manually
* Human Style team modeling

Crew - top level organization
AI Agent - Specialized team members
Process - Workflow management system
Tasks - Individual assignments

Crews vs. Flows

- Open-ended Research, content generation, descision workflow: Crews
- Decision workflows, API Orchestration: Flow
- Hybrid approach: BOTH
- Autonomous problem-solving, creative collaboration or exploratory task choose -Crews-
- Deterministic outcomes, auditability, or precise control over execution choose -Flows-
- Choose both when your application needs both structured processes and pockets of autonomous intelligence
